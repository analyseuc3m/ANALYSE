This repository contains the Open edX platform release "hotfix-2014-11-17" with ANALYSE module.

Overview of ANALYSE
------------------

ANALYSE is learning analytics tool developed for Open edX. This is a beta release which extends the learning analytics functionality of Open edX with 12 new visualizations. A new tab has been addded in the course dashboard to access ANALYSE. Some of the features are the next:

<ul>
<li>The learning analytics dashboard has 3 visualizations related to exercises, 4 related to videos and 4 related to general course activity</li>
<li>The instructors of a course can access the information about the aggregate of all students in a course an also each student individually. That allows instructor to keep track about how the course is progressing and control each student separately</li>
<li>The students in a course can access their own information only which can be used for self-awareness and reflect on their learning process</li>
<li>The different indicators are processed in background in regular intervals of time as schedule jobs by the use of Celery Beat</li>
</ul>
Installation
------------
For the installation of ANALYSE you can either:

<ul>
<li>Use this full repository of Open edX which has the both the "hotfix-2016-03-17" release and ANALYSE module.
Merge pull request #11842 from edx/hotfix/2016-03-17</li>
<li>Take ANALYSE code and insert it in a different Open edX release. Although we cannot guarantee that there will be no problems. This tool has been used in the last two releases: cypress and dogwood
</ul>

The functionality of ANALYSE has been added as a new django application. The different files and folders added for ANALYSE are the next:
<ul>

<li>/lms/static/sass/course/learning_analytics/_learning_analytics.scss</li>
<li>/lms/templates/learning_analytics/*</li>
<li>/lms/envs/devstack_analytics.py</li>
</ul>
The files from Open edX that has been modified to introduce ANALYSE:
<li>/setup.py</li>
<li>/lms/djangoapps/courseware/tabs.py</li>
<li>/common/lib/xmodule/xmodule/tabs.py</li>
<li>/lms/static/sass/_build-course.scss</li>
<li>/lms/urls.py</li>
